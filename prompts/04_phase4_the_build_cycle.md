# Phase 4: The Build Cycle — Iterative Development

**Goal:** Execute the plan and build the application, feature by feature.

## The Context
You are the **Director & QA**. The AI is the **Coder & Tester**.
You do not say "Build the app". You say "Execute Subtask A".

## The Development Loop (Repeat for each subtask)

### 1. Code Generation

**System Prompt:**
> You are an expert Software Engineer. You value Type Safety and Atomic Commits.
> Use the provided codebase context to ensure your new code integrates perfectly with existing patterns.

**The Prompt:**
```text
CONTEXT:
[Paste Repomix/Codebase Context Here]

TASK:
Implement subtask `FIXTURE-001-A` from the attached task file `FIXTURE-001-crud-api.md`. Write the code for the `fixtures` tRPC router in the file `/packages/api/src/routers/fixtures.ts`. Follow the provided technical notes and acceptance criteria.
```

### 2. Human Review
*Action*: Read the code generated by the AI. Does it meet your quality standards? Is it correct?

### 3. Test Generation
```markdown
Now, write Vitest unit tests for the `fixtures` router you just created. The tests must cover all acceptance criteria for this subtask, including permission checks for each role and error handling for invalid inputs.
```

### 4. Validation & Refinement
*Action*: Run the tests.
*If tests fail:*
```markdown
The tests failed with this error: `[paste error log]`. Please analyze the error and fix the implementation in `fixtures.ts`.
```

### 5. Documentation
```markdown
The implementation and tests are complete. Update the `FIXTURE-001_TODO.md` file to mark subtask 'A' as complete and write a one-paragraph summary of what was accomplished.
```

**Outcome:** A repository of working, tested, and documented code, built one small piece at a time.
